 # Resources
 
 Here are some of the resources that I found were immensely helpful while I we were building this playground.
 ___
 
 1: [Basics: Animations](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/basics/animations)
 
 This is a Swift By Sundell article under the Basics category. John Sundell is an excellent resource for learning all things Swift. He posts a new article every Sunday, so keep an eye out.

 2: [Ray Wenderlich: Animations By Tutorials](https://store.raywenderlich.com/a/46236/link/16)

 3: [Mark Moeykens: Animations Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHDMmeIMXj8WBu4oV4pHQd7513DVWzoLL)
 
 If you haven't heard of Mark Moeyken, **STOP** what you're doing and click the link. It'll take you to a playlist of his animations tutorial videos. I can't speak highly enough of Mark. He's an iOS developer who has an excellent eye for design/UI/UX and on top of it, he's an excellent teacher as well. Subscribe to his chanel, follow him on Twitter, and watch his content regularly. You won't be sorry.

 4: [WWDC: Advanced Animations with UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/230/)
 
 As you may well know, Apple has an annual conference for developers called WWDC. They post many of their presentations online for the public. This one discusses all the new animations api's as well as some of the more advanced techniques. Definetely worth the watch.
